# Interactive Control specialization for FS17

This is specialization for Farming Simulator 17 - Interactive Control.

## History

This specialization is available many years now. In year 2014 I was asked to add monitors feature into old IC. I've done this and also started to create new concept of IC. In FS15 there was some releases, but then I've ended with scripting for FS. This was due to my graduation exams and because I went to college.

In summer 2017 GtX from LS Modcompany contacted me and asked me to revide his convert of IC to FS17. I was excited and I started to revide his code. At same time I realized that events are old and not maintained and IC should be done better. So I started to creating new version - version 4.0.0

## Documentation

Interactive Control from version 4.0.0. comes with documentation in english. You can translate documentation into your native language if you want. Good point to start in documentation is on [front page of this docu](./documentation/en/README.md). I hope you'll find all you need.
